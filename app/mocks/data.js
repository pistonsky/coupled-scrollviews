We used smarty templates there, and the system did not even have jquery, so I made a revolution. Need to develop couple new modules like integrated update system? Sure. Then we decided to stop making new modules for the old system and develop the new completely redesigned asterisk-based PBX. I was given a list of desired features, put them all in Pivotal Tracker, choosed Yii as a lightweight convenient framework, and started working. The modules were quite techy, with even audio playback functionalities. I implemented a very useful access control role system that I later used in another project in the company. My need in exciting tasks was fullfilled, it is very important for me. In fall 2013 we started developing an Android app, so I got a lot of new experience in Java and in developing for mobile, but still continued to do PHP server scripts and web interfaces' backends. Later that android app solution was recognized by a bigger Moscow-based company and they even tried to buy the whole solution idea. The new IP PBX that I developed was also recognized by a bigger local company which allowed Lynks Limited to expand and grow their markets.",
